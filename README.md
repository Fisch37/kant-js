# Kant JS
This is a JavaScript interpreter for the [XMLang](https://github.com/Fisch37/xmlang) project.
The goal is to implement all the XMLang specifications, including all parts of the standard library.
Once full release versions are added, this project will follow the newest release and releases here
will be annotated with the relevant XMLang version.

The interpreter will be isolated to a single file so that it can easily be used in HTML files with a script tag.
